Hello Every Body

This Project is Just a Test Page designed with JavaScript (react framework) and I used:
  
 ### **React.js**
  
 ### **Raect hook** (just useState)
  
 ### ***Redux*** :)
  
  and 
 ### **StyledComponents** 
  for styling the page
  
  here is a screenshot of App:

It's jsut a single page search engine that powerd by ***Google*** and you can search in ***NationalGeographic.com***!

**Note:** Google CSE (**C**ustom **S**earch **E**ngine) is a service that help you make your special search engine
